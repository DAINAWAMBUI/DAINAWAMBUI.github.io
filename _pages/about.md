I am a dedicated and results-driven IT professional with experience in customer support, ERP consulting, and system administration. With a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from Taita Taveta University, I bring a strong foundation in system troubleshooting, user training, and software support.
As a Customer Support Specialist at Slip Limited, I successfully trained over 50+ system users and resolved critical technical issues to enhance user experience. My expertise includes ERP systems (Odoo, Microsoft Dynamics, HansaWorld), programming (Python, HTML, JavaScript), and version control (Git, GitHub).
I am passionate about problem-solving, cybersecurity, and driving innovation within organizations. I thrive in collaborative environments and am always eager to learn new technologies to improve efficiency.
